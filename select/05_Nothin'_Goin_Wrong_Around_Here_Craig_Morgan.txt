Ain't but a half a mile between the city limit signs
Population nine hundred 'n' nine
A lotta front porch swingin', down home livin'
Friday night hell raisin', Sunday morning repentance
We got our gossip goin' on down at Betty's Beauty Shop
They're sellin' 90 proof corn juice out back at the co-op
Judge Taylor likes to fight when his potbelly's full of beer
Theres always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
We got kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales being told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin goin' wrong around here
Old men bettin' on the weather on the courthouse stairs
Luther wackin' off weeds in his underwear
They go moon skinny-dippin' this time of year
Theres always somethin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
Other than kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales bein' told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
Only time Sheriff Lester breaks his handcuffs out
Is when his wife's been drinkin' and they're back at the house
He'll be walking' 'round for days in a daze grinnin' ear to ear
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' going wrong around here
