There ain't nothin' out here but dogs and a yard
And a couple John Deeres, some fallin' down barns
Yeah, it's pretty damn clear like lightening in a jar
If you passed it on the interstate I bet you'd say

There ain't nothin' out here, there ain't a skyline
If you seen it from a Learjet I bet you'd ask why
Anybody down there would wanna live and die
Somewhere you gotta be lost to go, but they don't know

We all ride with that out of touch label
Turn that dirt into what's on the table
And we don't need no shiny good time
We're fine with a county line kinda cold beer
Keep those dust-covered, rusty trucks runnin'
You kissed on the bus, now you raisin' up youngins
All you're gonna find windin' through the country
Is some middle-of-nowhere folks
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' out here

Yeah, it ain't nothin' out here to wake up with the sun
Throw your Get 'Er Done in gear, no quttin' till it's done
Thank the man upstairs that gave you what you got
May not look like a lot outside lookin' in
Aw, but then again

We all ride with that out of touch label
Turn that dirt into what's on the table
And we don't need no shiny good time
We're fine with a county line kinda cold beer
Keep those dust-covered, rusty trucks runnin'
You kissed on the bus, now you raisin' up youngins
All you're gonna find windin' through the country
Is some middle-of-nowhere folks
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' out here

Might live a little different out here
Might be a little simple, little slow like people say
But at the end of the day

We all ride with that out of touch label
We turn that dirt into what's on the table
And we don't need no shiny good time
We're fine with a county line kinda cold beer
Keep those dust-covered, rusty trucks runnin'
You kissed on the bus, now you raisin' up youngins
All you're gonna find windin' through the country
Is some middle-of-nowhere folks makin'
Somethin' outta nothin' out here (Woo)
Yeah, we're all makin' somethin' outta nothin' out here
All makin' somethin' outta nothin' out here
