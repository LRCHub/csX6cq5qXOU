My truck, my boat
My drink, my smoke
My old broken-in boots
My old dog Blue

My truck, my boat
My drink, my smoke
My old broken-in boots
My old dog Blue
Got nothin' on you
Everything I got got nothin' on you

Every song in this guitar
Every dollar in my jar
Daddy's watch here on my wrist
Every girl I ever kissed

Every song in this guitar
Every dollar in my jar
Daddy's watch here on my wrist
Every girl I ever kissed
Got nothin' on you
Everything I got got nothin' on you

Every star in the sky
Every piece of Mama's pie
Every, every little thing
Girl, you put 'em all to shame

Every star in the sky
Every piece of Mama's pie
Every, every little thing
Girl, you put 'em all to shame
Got nothin' on you
Everything I got got nothin' on you

The way you wear that dress
It puts a skip in my chest
The way you hang it on the door
The way you drop it on the floor

The way you wear that dress
Puts a skip in my chest
Way you hang it on the door
Way you drop it on the floor
Nothing I like more, no
Than nothin' on you, girl
Than nothin' on you, girl
Than nothin' on you
